# Optimisation-Python
This repository is intends to gather some basic optimisation algorithms in python, in order to study their behaviour and compare them in the a generic framework. It may also contains some application designed to solve problems arising in the field of Machine Learning or Compressed Sensing.

All the ipython notebook you can find there have been originally designed by
 -Gabriel Peyr√© : http://www.numerical-tours.com/
And the version that has been used here has been modified by
 -Laurent Condat : http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~laurent.condat/
 
Which are well reknown researcher in advanced optimisation technics for signal processing.

I only wrote some part of the solution of each problem, and eventually made some slight modifications, so all the credit belongs to them.
