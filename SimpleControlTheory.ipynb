    "### What is control theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Control theory is about manipulating a system that is sometimes call a process, or a model of a system through a set of input so that the output correspond to some kind of expected value.\n",
    "The system can be subject to arbitrary external inputs as well (perturbations due to external factors, such as temperature going down in winter, light going down at night or water flow going when raining) that may vary in time.\n",
    "In the meantime, to help us control the process, we get feedback of what is happening, so that we can compute and apply the best possible response to the current situation, unfortunately, the sensor that measures the output of the process might be subject to some noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](data/PID_en-1024x364.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In practice, the output of the process that we would like to control is called $y(t)$\n",
    "* The desired output value of the process is called $r(t)$\n",
    "* The measured output value of the process is called $m(t)$\n",
    "* The delta ($\\delta$) between command and measure, is called $e(t)$ ie $e(t)=r(t)-m(t)$\n",
    "* The command sent to the process is called u(t)\n",
    "\n",
    "Control theory is about how to compute the best $u(t)$ for each $t$ so that the outcome of the process $y(t)$ is as close as possible to $r(t)$, the desired value.\n"

    "Part of control theory is about model estimation. But estimating a model given a set of input and output, and how to optimally sample the system, is somehow a different problem that is more general than control theory.\n",

    "But there are still many aspects of control theory that lead to evaluate or take into account a subset of the properties of the system, especially regarding temporal properties, like, how much current input influences the short term output, or longer term output. Is there a time delay in the system under which nothing from the input will be reflected in the output ?\n",

    "#### Remarks on validity of system estimation\n",
    "Actually, the only way to justify rigorously that the above manipulation is valid is to check the answer we have found really is the correct answer. Indeed, to be allowed to perform the manipulations we must assume the existence of a domain on which both $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are analytic. If we assume $y(t)$ is \"nice\" then, under that assumption, prove that y(t) is \"nice\", that does not mean $y(t)$ is nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rigorous justification would look something like the following:\n",
    "First we must make some assumption about the input sequence, otherwise we have no idea what ROC to use.\n",

    "If we are interested in inputs that are uniformly bounded and which are zero up until time 0 then we can safely assume that $x(t)$ is analytic on $|t| < 1$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore it is easy to show that the product $y(t) = h(t) x(t)$ will be analytic on $|t| < 1$.\n",
    "This means that $y(t)$ can be safely expanded as a power series in a neighbourhood of the origin, and the coefficients of that power series are what we believe the output of the system will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check this really is the output of the system, it suffices to show that $y(t) = \\frac12 t\\,y(t) + x(t)$ for $|t| < 1$.\n",

It is much simpler to go the other way and define a system directly in terms of $h(t)$ and its ROC.

As the pole gets closer to the unit circle (that is, $r \\rightarrow 1$) the impulse response takes longer to die out. Engineers care about pole placement!"
