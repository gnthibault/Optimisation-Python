    "### Definition of $G$\n",
    "It is interesting to notice that, depending on a scaling factor used for our definition, we can write that $G = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} F$ is a unitary matrix.\n",
    "Ie the following equalities holds:\n",
    "* $G.G^{\\star} = Id(N)$\n",
    "* $G^{\\star}.G = Id(N)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We recall that $G^{\\star}$ is called the adjoint matrix of $G$, it is the transpose of G where each coefficient has been conjugated.\n",
    "This construction is also sometimes called the Hermitian conjugate.\n",
    "Showing that $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} F$ is the actual adjoint of $\\sqrt{N} F^{-1}$ is rather easy if you notice that those matrices are both symmetric, and that $\\overline{e^{\\alpha j}} = e^{-\\alpha j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the product makes them unitary is also pretty easy when dividing the output in two case:\n",
    "* on diagonal: each term in the sum has the form $e^{\\alpha j} \\times e^{-\\alpha j} = 1$ and the $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}$ makes the overall norm to be 1\n",
    "* off diagonal: We can reorder all the terms to exhibit 1 on one side minus the formula for partition of unity on the other side which amounts to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orthonogonality for complex valued vectors\n",
    "The very nice property that arise when one matrix verify the unitary property is the orthogonality of its column vector. When working on the field of real numbers, unitary matrices and orthonormal matrices have the same definition because transpose (orthonormal) is the same as hermitian transpose (unitary).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the field of complex number, we talk about unitary matrices, but the semantic behind is close: you can see directly from $G.G^{\\star} = Id(N)$ that each column vector of $G$ is either orthogonal with the other, or colinear with itself, and has norm 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working on a field equipped with an hermitian product helps define useful algebraic structure like Hilbert spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unitary matrices are stable\n",
    "The product of two unitary matrices is another unitary matrix. The inverse of a unitary matrix is another unitary matrix, and identity matrices are unitary. Hence the set of unitary matrices form a group, called the unitary group.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is especially usefull when composing transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unitary does not mean hermitian\n",
    "Hermitian symmetry extends some of the properties of symmetric matrices to the complex field, like positive semi-definiteness:  $<z, Mz> = z^{\\star} M z \\geq 0 \\forall z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of complex number, hermitian matrices are defined as: $A \\; \\text{s.t} \\; a_{ij} = \\overline{a_{ij}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "All hermitian matrices are positive semi definite. But there is no reason for our Fourier matrix $G$ to be hermitian\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectral theorem for normal matrices\n",
    "We also recall that unitary matrices are also commuting matrices by construction: $AB = BA$ when one matrix commutes with its adjoint we also say that this matrix is normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can show that A is normal if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Where $V$ is also a unitary matrix. The proof uses Schurr decomposition.\n",

    "Interestingly, given the unitary property in addition, both $G^{\\star}$ and $G$  have all their eigenvalues lying on the unit circle. This can be shown using the fact that unitary matrices preserve the Hermitian inner product:\n",

    "In a quite famous paper, Bruckstein, Donoho and Elad have explored the link between the fundamental uncertainty principle (see our notebook on the Heisenberg–Pauli–Weyl inequality) and the resolution of systems of linear equations, the name of the paper was: From sparse solutions of systems of equations to sparse modeling of signals and images.\n",

    "### Original problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural way to formalize the sparsity problem in Fourier domain, given a linear operator $M$ in the context of inverse problem, is to use a $L_0$ norm penalty on the Fourier coefficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is not even easy to see here if the analysis problem make sense. At first sight, it seems more simple as it allows to restricts the search space to $\\mathbb{R}^N$ instead of $\\mathbb{C}^N$ and has less constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, it is not sure that this formulation will still make sens when we will try to solve the problem: we may have to search inside $\\mathbb{C}^N$ and eventually we also might need to use the real signal set indicator: $\\chi_{\\mathbb{R}^N}(Gx)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For people familiar to signal processing, it is well know that real signal have a specific property in Fourier domain:\n",

    "* Imaginary part of Fourier transform is odd\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, one can see that the underlying dimension of the problem given the realness of the function in direct domain is the same wether we are trying to solve it in the direct domain or in the Fourier domain."
